## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a program used by programmers to do many things such as: cloning repositories from GitHub as well as uploading any changes made to the project being worked on.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
GitHub seems to be a website that hosts files, where as Git itself seems to be a client side tool to upload and download from GitHub.

3. Why do we create a branch?
We create branches so that when we upload our changes we do not directly effect the main copy of the file. Such as forking.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A Pull Request lets you tell other programmers that you have made changes to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
You can use the command: 'git checkout another_branch' to switch to a different branch.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch: Downloads new data from a remote repository.
git merge: This is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.
git pull: Allows you to update your current head branch.

7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when someone tries to edit code that another developer may already be working on.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You can resolve this issue by working in different branches.
